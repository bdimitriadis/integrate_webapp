Risk Radar PN is designed to respond to situations where there is insufficient confidence, security or willingness to communicate the recent diagnosis of sexually transmitted infection to sexual partners. Most people prefer to be notified in person or not anonymously (personal message). If anyone other than your sexual partner (s) can read the message you sent, do not use Risk Radar PN.</p>

This data is used in case of misuse for civil liability purposes.</p>
