Half of all HIV cases in Russia are now due to heterosexual sex, and in the former Soviet states excluding Russia, <a href=\"http://www.aidsmap.com/Nearly-two-thirds-of-European-HIV-cases-are-now-in-Russia/page/3109895/\">65% of new diagnoses in 2016 were ascribed to heterosexual contact</a>, though these may include some unacknowledged men who have sex with men (MSM).</p>\n<p><strong>Trans women</strong> worldwide are estimated to have an HIV prevalence rate of <a href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(12)70315-8/abstract\">one in five (19%</a>), 49 times higher than the general population. In three studies that measured new diagnoses in particular populations of trans women, annual incidence was calculated to be <a href=\"http://www.aidsmap.com/Transgender-people-are-at-high-risk-for-HIV-but-too-little-is-known-about-prevention-and-treatment-for-this-population/page/3042613/\">between 1.2 and 3.6% a year</a>.</p>\n<p>In the US, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6446a4.htm\">the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates</a> that 25% of MSM but only 0.4% of heterosexual cis women have the kind of risk of acquiring HIV that would indicate PrEP. But in terms of numbers, that means 492,000 gay men and 468,000 cis heterosexual women \u2013 nearly as many.</p>\n<p>In the US, PrEP uptake was initially <a href=\"http://www.abstractsonline.com/Plan/ViewAbstract.aspx?sKey=82e8e4ce-547b-433f-b257-e55346c0889b&amp;cKey=6e2042ca-c7c7-4d3b-aa69-00a168288786&amp;mKey=7dd36e88-52c3-4ff1-a5df-1d00766558b8\">as high in women as in MSM</a>. But while the number of MSM accessing PrEP has increased rapidly, the number of women has stayed at about 2500 a year. As a result, prescriptions for women declined from 49% of the total in 2012 to 11% in 2015. Women were also more likely only to have one prescription for PrEP.</p>\n<p>In Europe, <a href=\"http://www.aidsmap.com/PrEP-rollout-recipients-in-France-top-1000-full-trial-results-report-97-effectiveness/page/3075552/\">only 3% of PrEP users in France are women</a>, one year after PrEP introduction. It\u2019s too early to collect data from other European countries with new PrEP programmes.</p>\n<p>The low uptake of PrEP among women is due to several factors.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Women at high risk of HIV are scattered throughout the population and do not form as coherent or easily addressed a group as gay men.</li>\n<li>Women may be less aware of PrEP \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.aidsmap.com/Survey-finds-good-knowledge-of-PrEP-in-Europe-and-a-considerable-amount-of-unsupported-informal-PrEP-use/page/3102845/\">as the Flash! PrEP study showed</a> \u2013 and may also be less aware they are at risk of HIV. Women may become aware of PrEP through an exposure incident, and clinics supplying <a href=\"https://cliniq.org.uk/pep-prep/emergency-hiv-drugs-post-exposure-prophylaxis-pep/\"><em>post</em>-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)</a> \u2013 should inform people seeking PEP about PrEP.</li>\n<li>Women at enough risk of HIV to need PrEP tend to have other social and health disadvantages, such as recent immigration status, poor housing, or experiencing domestic abuse. These are associated with poor access to health care generally. Projects working with disadvantaged women should know about PrEP.</li>\n<li>PrEP in Europe will initially be offered through sexual health clinics. Women with sexual health needs do not visit these as much as gay men, preferring to access care through family planning clinics or GPs. In the US, it was notable that a high proportion of the first wave of PrEP prescribing for women was by primary care physicians.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Only daily PrEP is recommended for women</h3>\n<p>There are some clinical differences that mean women\u2019s response to PrEP may differ from gay men. Levels of tenofovir reach maximum concentration (so-called \u2018steady state\u2019) more slowly in vaginal than in rectal tissue \u2013 after seven rather than after two doses. Although this is not the case with emtricitabine levels, it may mean that women need to take PrEP for several days before it is fully protective, and may need higher levels of adherence for it to be effective. Until we have data to say otherwise, it is recommended that women take PrEP daily, and do not take event-driven PrEP.</p>\n<p>It should also be noted that we know almost nothing about PrEP concentration in penile/urethral tissue and until we know more, heterosexual men and insertive trans women should only take daily PrEP too.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>In the UK, the <a href=\"http://sophiaforum.net/\">Sophia Forum</a>, the group for women living with HIV, is joining with <a href=\"https://cliniq.org.uk/pep-prep/emergency-hiv-drugs-post-exposure-prophylaxis-pep/\">CliniQ</a>, the trans person\u2019s clinic run by Dean Street in London, to set up a resource for women and PrEP. PrEP in Europe would be interested to hear about similar women\u2019s resources elsewhere.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n  \t  </div>"

    "title": "Is PrEP worth it?",
    "text": "<div class=\"sleeve\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<p>Due to the price of the antiretroviral drugs, PrEP is a more expensive way of preventing HIV, in terms of its cost \u2018per dose\u2019, than most other methods.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, many scientific models have calculated that a PrEP programme can more than recoup its cost and save money compared with not adopting PrEP, which results in more HIV infections and high costs of lifetime treatment.</p>\n<p>Whether PrEP is value for money depends crucially on three issues:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The actual cost of drugs: not only of PrEP, but also of the HIV treatment needed if PrEP is not adopted and HIV infection is not averted;</li>\n<li>The likelihood of the person or population acquiring HIV if they do not take PrEP;</li>\n<li>The time scale over which any savings due to PrEP are measured.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The <em>cost </em>of PrEP is quite easy to calculate. If, say, 10,000 people took daily <em>Truvada </em>PrEP at the current list price of approximately \u20ac450 a month, it would cost at most \u20ac54m a year. (It would in fact cost less than this due to the proportion of people who would take PrEP intermittently and to local price negotiations.) Reducing the price to the current generic PrEP price of about \u20ac45 a month would cut this price by 90%, i.e. \u20ac5.4m a year.</p>\n<p>Cost-<em>effectiveness</em> is a more complex issue. Even within treatment, controversies regularly occur as to whether a drug is \u2018affordable\u2019 in terms of cost per lives saved.</p>\n<p>In addition, with a prevention measure, a lot of people will take it who would not have acquired the infection anyway. Even if 10% of a group of people acquire HIV every year \u2013 an extremely high incidence rate, about that seen in <a href=\"http://www.aidsmap.com/Pre-exposure-prophylaxis-PrEP-stops-86-of-HIV-infections-in-PROUD-study/page/2947319/\">the PROUD trial</a> \u2013 this means 90% of them would not have acquired HIV.</p>\n<p>A 10% annual incidence rate, however, does translate into a rate of over 50% acquiring HIV within eight years, so <em>over time</em> PrEP would stop more infections. On the other hand, most people do not stay at this kind of risk of HIV for long.</p>\n<p>Cost-effectiveness studies calculate the extra cost, or the savings, the new intervention will produce over a specific timeline. What is regarded as \u2018cost-effective\u2019 is not the same as what saves costs. This is because it is recognised that medical innovations justify some extra cost. A cost of about \u20ac30,000 per life-year saved is usually regarded as cost-effective in a high-income setting.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001401\">A systematic review of PrEP cost-effectiveness studies</a> published in 2013 looked at 13 studies in various countries and found large variation in the results, depending on the assumptions put into the models. Most of these, however, used outdated assumptions about the likely effectiveness of PrEP.</p>\n<p>In Europe, there have been four more recent cost-effectiveness studies published, two based on the UK, one based on the Netherlands, and one based on France.</p>\n<p>The first UK study found that <a href=\"http://www.aidsmap.com/Provision-of-PrEP-in-the-UK-will-be-cost-effective-for-gay-men-at-high-risk-of-HIV-model-finds/page/2972926/\">PrEP would save money in the long term</a> even if offered at current drug prices if restricted to gay men with multiple partners (over five within three months). However, because of the initial outlay on PrEP, for larger populations PrEP would only start saving money within 15 years if drug prices were reduced by at least 80%.</p>\n<p>The second UK study found that <a href=\"http://www.aidsmap.com/Second-UK-cost-effectiveness-study-finds-that-large-PrEP-programmes-may-need-drug-price-cut-to-be-affordable/page/3000951/\">PrEP would be cost-saving if PrEP was 86% effective</a> (as in PROUD) or was available at less than 25% of the current price.</p>\n<p>The study from the Netherlands similarly found that <a href=\"http://www.aidsmap.com/Dutch-model-finds-PrEP-for-high-risk-gay-men-is-cost-effective-at-current-prices-and-cost-saving-at-generic-prices/page/3086496/\">PrEP would be cost-saving over a relatively short time span, even at current drug prices</a>, if given only to gay men who were at the very highest risk of acquiring HIV and would be cost-saving, even if most gay men at significant risk took it, if drug prices fell by 70%. Notably, this model includes so-called secondary infections, assuming that each HIV prevention averted actually stops 1.7 infections overall.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.aidsmap.com/PrEP-rollout-recipients-in-France-top-1000-full-trial-results-report-97-effectiveness/page/3075552/#item3075556\">The study from France</a> only looked at the cost of PrEP versus the cost of treating HIV over a single year. Not surprisingly, it found that at current drug prices and over this short timescale, the cost of PrEP would not pass the test of cost-effectiveness. However, it found that if the price of drugs fell by 88%, and if intermittent dosing based on <a href=\"http://www.aidsmap.com/Ipergay-PrEP-study-results-published/page/3018781/\">the Ipergay model</a> was used, PrEP would be cost-effective even within the first year of implementation. This implies it would be cost-saving over a longer timescale.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"http://www.aidsmap.com/New-US-PrEP-cost-effectiveness-model-finds-drug-prices-will-need-to-drop-substantially-if-HIV-risk-rises-or-if-adherence-is-only-moderate/page/3171377/\">recent US study</a> looked at the cost-benefit of just one year\u2019s worth of a PrEP programme versus the cost of the lifetime HIV infections that would otherwise have happened. It found that if PrEP effectiveness was only 44% (as in the iPrEx study) and full-price <em>Truvada </em>was used, then the cost per QALY saved would be $64,000 which \u2013 though within what the US healthcare system regards as cost-effective would be unlikely to be afforded. If, however, either effectiveness was 92% \u2013 as it was in the US sites of iPrEx \u2013 or if the price of tenofovir/emtricitabine was reduced by 80%, then PrEP would not only be cost-saving but cost-effective.</p>\n  \t  </div>"

    "title": "Why PrEP",
    "text": "<div class=\"sleeve\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<p>Antiretrovirals (ARVs) are the drugs used to treat people living with HIV. PrEP is a way of giving ARVs to HIV-<em>negative</em> people to <strong>prevent</strong> them getting HIV.</p>\n<p>People living with HIV who take antiretroviral therapy (ART) can now expect a near-normal life span; most deaths due to AIDS now happen in people who do not know they have HIV, start treatment when they are already seriously ill, or who cannot get ART.</p>\n<p>But having HIV requires that people take a combination of drugs for the rest of their lives, and for some people the drugs will have side-effects.</p>\n<p>Although HIV is now a manageable condition, it is still a very stigmatised one. People living with HIV can face isolation, rejection and violence. In many countries, they may also face jail if they fail to disclose their infection, whether or not they pass on HIV or even could do so.</p>\n<p>PrEP, in contrast, involves taking only one HIV drug or, more often, two HIV drugs in one pill, and only for as long as you need to take it.</p>\n<p>Because PrEP only needs to be taken during the times in people\u2019s lives they are at risk of HIV, it is cheaper than a lifelong supply of ARVs, and people taking it are less likely to experience side-effects.</p>\n<p>Condoms, of course, are highly protective against HIV <a href=\"http://www.aidsmap.com/Consistent-and-correct-condom-use-reduces-risk-of-bacterial-STIs-by-60/page/2522036/\">when used consistently and correctly</a>, and protect against most sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Distributing free or cheap condoms <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3180557/pdf/10461_2010_Article_9812.pdf\">is still one of the most cost-effective ways of preventing HIV</a>.</p>\n<p>However, while condoms are highly <em>efficacious</em> in preventing individual instances of infection, they are often not <em>effective</em> enough when used as an overall HIV prevention strategy. Studies show that the chance of acquiring HIV <a href=\"http://www.aidsmap.com/Do-condoms-work/page/1746203/\">is reduced by 65 to 85%</a> in people who try to use condoms correctly 100% of the time. While this is a substantial reduction, it shows that even the most conscientious condom users may not be fully protected.</p>\n<p>The study that found that condoms <a href=\"http://www.aidsmap.com/CDC-researchers-publish-estimate-of-effectiveness-of-condom-use-in-anal-sex/page/2930716/\">reduce HIV acquisition by 70% in gay men</a> also found that maintaining 100% condom use over long periods of time was difficult for them; only one in six gay men in the study sustained 100% condom use over three years.</p>\n<p>Why don\u2019t people use condoms consistently and correctly? There are many reasons, but the root of one reason may lie in the fact that studies show that people (or at least men) <a href=\"http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~gl20/GeorgeLoewenstein/Papers_files/pdf/HeatMoment.pdf\">make extremely poor risk decisions when already sexually aroused</a> \u2013 even if not under the influence of drink or drugs.</p>\n<p>PrEP, on the other hand, can be taken hours before sex, at a time when the person is more likely to be sober and rational. As a result, as studies have shown, it is generally more effective.</p>\n<p>Another factor may be erectile dysfunction during condom use \u2013 or fear of it. <a href=\"http://www.aidsmap.com/Erection-loss-with-condoms-predicts-subsequent-unsafe-sex/page/1431337/\">One study found</a> that men who had had one experience of erection failure when using a condom were less likely to use condoms next time they had sex. In addition, sometimes condoms <em>do</em> fail, largely due to incorrect technique.</p>\n<p>PrEP is not associated with \u2018performance anxiety\u2019 in the same way.</p>\n<p>PrEP may have significant positive \u2018side-effects\u2019 too. Using PrEP involves, or should involve, regular HIV testing and testing for other STIs too. <a href=\"http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=22817\">Recent falls in HIV diagnoses</a> seen in some UK clinics <a href=\"http://www.aidsmap.com/New-South-Wales-reports-record-drop-in-HIV-diagnoses-fewest-this-year-since-records-began/page/3167508/\">and also in Australia</a> may be due both to PrEP\u2019s direct effect, and to the encouragement it provides to test for HIV frequently, with resulting earlier treatment of people who test HIV positive.</p>\n<p>In addition, increased rates of detection and treatment for other STIs may start to bring STI rates down despite increased risk behaviour, <a href=\"http://www.aidsmap.com/STI-rates-in-PrEP-users-very-high-but-evidence-that-PrEP-increases-them-is-inconclusive/page/3119743/#item3119746\">as one model suggests</a>.</p>\n<p>PrEP, in short, is not merely an effective way of preventing HIV but has at least a potential role as a significant public health intervention.</p>\n  \t  </div>"

The Ipergay protocol was this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Take TWO <em>Truvada</em> pills from 24 hours to 2 hours in advance of an anticipated exposure to HIV.</li>\n<li>If you <em>do</em> have sex that risks exposure, then take another pill 2-24 hours <em>after </em>sex and another one the day after that (i.e. 26-50 hours after the last sex).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This diagram (in French) illustrates this:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.seronet.info/sites/default/files/shared/admin/images/ipergay1.png\">www.seronet.info/sites/default/files/shared/admin/images/ipergay1.png</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>If, however, you have sex that risks exposure again at some point in the two days after the first sex \u2013 then keep on taking one <em>Truvada</em> pill per day, until two days after your last sex. Only then stop.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here\u2019s an example illustrating this with three episodes of sex:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.seronet.info/sites/default/files/shared/admin/images/ipergay2.png\">www.seronet.info/sites/default/files/shared/admin/images/ipergay2.png</a></p>\n<p>This protocol might seem hard to follow, but it was clearly effective.</p>\n<p>On average, <em>Truvada</em> usage in Ipergay was about 50% of what it would have been with full adherence to daily PrEP. While some people took PrEP nearly every day, others used it rarely, though no single consistent adherence pattern was seen. Many people stopped PrEP altogether for several months then re-started it. Clearly, they were tailoring their PrEP use to their perceived level of need \u2013 and must have been doing it quite accurately.</p>\n<p>One caution voiced about intermittent PrEP is that many Ipergay participants were having sex so often that they were taking PrEP almost daily. But a recent analysis showed that <a href=\"http://www.aidsmap.com/Ipergay-trial-PrEP-still-protected-people-who-had-less-sex-and-used-it-less-often/page/3159786/\">the PrEP regimen in Ipergay was just as effective for participants who were having less sex</a> than average as it was for others.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.natap.org/2015/images/022515/022515-2/CROI12.gif\">This diagram shows detailed adherence by individuals during Ipergay</a>.</p>\n<p>In France, gay men are offered free choice over whether they wish to take PrEP daily or \u2018on demand\u2019, another term for intermittent PrEP. So far, about two-thirds have opted to take it intermittently. Intermittent PrEP was also offered in the <a href=\"http://www.avac.org/trial/amprep-amsterdam-prep\">AMPrEP</a> and <a href=\"http://www.avac.org/trial/be-prepared-antwerp-prep-project\">Be PrEPared</a> implementation studies in the Netherlands and Belgium, although it was only taken up by about one-third. When the big <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/update-on-prep-impact-trial-in-england\">IMPACT stud</a>y starts in England, people will be offered a choice of on-demand or daily PrEP too.</p>\n<p>Previous evidence had already shown that intermittent PrEP might work. In the iPrEx study, researchers noticed that <a href=\"http://www.aidsmap.com/Four-doses-of-PrEP-a-week-may-be-enough-to-protect/page/2279465/\">four or more doses of PrEP a week appeared to be enough to protect.</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.aidsmap.com/Non-daily-PrEP-regimens-provide-extra-options-but-adherence-is-often-better-with-daily-dosing/page/2986241/\">One other big study, ADAPT</a>, has compared the performance of different PrEP regimens in men and women. It compared daily PrEP with taking it every other day and with \u2018on demand\u2019 PrEP of <em>one</em> pill before and <em>one</em> after.

The lack of effect seen in these studies was entirely due to very low rates of actual use of PrEP.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://journals.lww.com/aidsonline/Fulltext/2016/07310/Effectiveness_and_safety_of_oral_HIV_preexposure.14.aspx\">A meta-analysis</a> by the World Health Organization published in July 2016, found that, averaged over all studies, PrEP stopped seven out of every ten HIV infections that would otherwise have happened. This meta-analysis by definition includes studies with very low rates of PrEP adherence.</p>\n<p>If taken consistently enough, PrEP is almost 100% effective. There are only three convincingly documented cases, among well over 100,000 users, where <a href=\"http://www.aidsmap.com/Unique-case-of-PrEP-failure-without-drug-resistance-reported-from-Amsterdam/page/3118230/\">people acquired HIV despite good adherence to PrEP</a>; \u00a0<a href=\"http://www.aidsmap.com/Almost-certain-case-of-PrEP-failure-due-to-drug-resistance-reported-at-CROI-2016/page/3039748/\">in two of these cases</a> the person was unlucky enough to acquire <a href=\"http://www.aidsmap.com/Second-case-report-of-PrEP-failure-due-to-drug-resistant-virus/page/3093327/\">a rare, highly drug-resistant virus</a>.</p>\n<p>The first study that showed that PrEP could work against sexual transmission of HIV was <a href=\"http://www.aidsmap.com/The-iPrEx-study/page/1746640/\">the iPrEx study of PrEP in MSM</a>, which reported its result in November 2010. The reduction in HIV infections in gay men given PrEP was 44%.</p>\n<p>This reduction now seems modest, but it was a significant breakthrough at the time. Effectiveness was not greater than this because, in the study sites with the largest numbers of participants, only a minority took PrEP as prescribed. Overall adherence in the study, as measured by drug levels, was 51%. In men who actually consistently took PrEP as recommended, the reduction in HIV was around 73%.</p>\n<p>In July 2011, a study in Kenya and Uganda found that PrEP was also effective at preventing HIV transmission in heterosexual couples of different HIV status in long-term relationships. <a href=\"http://www.aidsmap.com/The-Partners-PrEP-trial/page/2213106/\">The Partners PrEP study</a> found that, overall, PrEP reduced infections by 67%. There was no significant difference in effectiveness between men and women. This was one of the few studies that looked at solo tenofovir as PrEP as well as tenofovir/emtricitabine, and it found that tenofovir was just as effective.</p>\n<p>Around the same time, <a href=\"http://www.aidsmap.com/The-TDF2-trial/page/2213126/\">the TDF2 trial</a> among 1200 heterosexual women and men in Botswana found an overall effectiveness of 63%, but an effectiveness of 78% if people who had not had any PrEP for over a month were excluded. Effectiveness was the same in men and women.</p>\n<p>Two other studies conducted with women in African countries, however, found that PrEP had no effectiveness. The <a href=\"http://www.aidsmap.com/The-FEM-PrEP-study/page/1821879/\">FEM-PrEP</a> and <a href=\"http://www.aidsmap.com/VOICE-trials-disappointing-result-poses-big-questions-for-PrEP/page/2586636/\">VOICE</a> studies, reporting in March 2011 and February 2013, found that PrEP usage had been too low for it to have any effect. Only about a quarter of women in either study took PrEP often enough for it to work. The reasons adherence was low were complex but centred on two issues; <a href=\"http://www.aidsmap.com/Stigma-ambivalence-and-other-priorities-the-VOICE-C-study/page/2907827/\">distrust that the PrEP would work</a> and the fact that <a href=\"http://www.aidsmap.com/Women-in-PrEP-trial-feared-they-would-have-to-leave-study-if-they-reported-low-adherence/page/2959955/\">women really joined the studies for the good medical care they offered</a>, not for the PrEP.</p>\n<p>At this point in 2013 then, while PrEP was already approved in the US, it was still possible to argue that while there was evidence that PrEP <em>could</em> work, its overall effectiveness was no higher than that of consistent condom use.</p>\n<p>In late 2014, however, two studies among MSM in Europe, PROUD and IPERGAY, changed the picture for PrEP and laid the foundation for its widespread adoption. Both studies <a href=\"http://www.aidsmap.com/High-effectiveness-seen-in-English-PrEP-trial/page/2912952/\">closed earlier than planned in November 2013</a> when it became clear that <a href=\"http://www.aidsmap.com/High-effectiveness-seen-in-English-PrEP-trial/page/2912952/\">effectiveness was much higher than expected</a>. When results were announced in February 2015, <a href=\"http://www.aidsmap.com/Pre-exposure-prophylaxis-also-stops-86-of-HIV-infections-in-Ipergay-study/page/2947854/\">both studies</a> found, coincidentally, that people taking PrEP <a href=\"http://www.aidsmap.com/Pre-exposure-prophylaxis-PrEP-stops-86-of-HIV-infections-in-PROUD-study/page/2947319/\">had 86% fewer HIV infections</a> than people not taking PrEP. No person who acquired HIV in either study had actually been taking PrEP at the time.</p>\n<p>Several other studies since then have found similar results and tell a similar tale: PrEP is extremely effective \u2013 nearly 100% so \u2013 if taken consistently. Equally, some studies have found low adherence and so lower effectiveness in people who may find it difficult to take PrEP consistently enough, including <a href=\"http://www.aidsmap.com/Young-gay-men-can-do-well-on-PrEP-but-may-need-more-support/page/3073111/\">adolescents</a>, <a href=\"http://www.aidsmap.com/Gay-youth-PrEP-study-finds-good-retention-and-reasonable-adherence/page/2987813/\">some black MSM</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.aidsmap.com/The-pros-and-cons-of-PrEP-trial-volunteers-recount-their-experience-of-the-ADAPT-study/page/2986782/#item2986784\">some women</a>.</p>\n<p>The picture is less certain when it comes to infection via non-sterile needles: there has been <a href=\"http://www.aidsmap.com/PrEP-works-for-injecting-drug-users-too/page/2678439/\">one scientific study of PrEP in people who inject drugs</a>, which reported an effectiveness of 49% in 2013. However, its methods, which include directly observed PrEP, may not reflect PrEP effectiveness in \u2018real world\u2019 situations in people who inject drugs. We need more studies with this population.</p>\n<p>When PrEP is provided in real world settings as part of a roll-out programme, it has proved to be just as effective as in trial settings. <a href=\"http://www.aidsmap.com/No-new-HIV-infections-in-Northern-California-Kaiser-PrEP-programme-but-STI-rates-rising/page/3113188/\">A study of a PrEP programme in northern California</a> that provided PrEP to nearly 1000 people found only two HIV infections, both of them in men who had had to discontinue PrEP due to loss of insurance.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n  \t  </div>"
